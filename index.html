        How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from
        web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be
        greater than 250 words

        I would advise a potential client to use a strong password with
        combination number, and special characters, and not used for multiple
        accounts, which would make it less damaging if it were to happen. I
        would also recommend using a verifying method like a multi-factor
        authentication, to Logg into different accounts, which adds a second
        form of identifying such as a code to their phone, in addition to their
        password, just like OneLogin, we use for login to Moodle.
